#### Lecture 1: [Introduction to Solana and Blockchain](https://youtu.be/okqyfP_h_54)
> Proof of History, Sealevel, and other Solana fundamentals. We will also go through a proper local development setup to get you started in this course.

#### Lecture 2: [Rust Introduction](https://youtu.be/PXf9iT2GJYU)
> A gentle introduction to Rust programming language. Principles behind Rust and how they tie to Solana program development.

#### Lecture 3: [Solana programming model I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plp4y27LNWs)
> Let's start developing on-chain Solana programs using the Anchor framework. You'll understand how programs store data and state on the Solana blockchain. We will review all the important core concepts of Solana development: Accounts structure, Program Derived Addresses, Handling errors, and Cross-Program Invocations.
