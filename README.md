#### Lecture 1: [Introduction to Solana and Blockchain](https://youtu.be/okqyfP_h_54)
> Proof of History, Sealevel, and other Solana fundamentals. We will also go through a proper local development setup to get you started in this course.

#### Lecture 2: [Rust Introduction](https://youtu.be/PXf9iT2GJYU)
> A gentle introduction to Rust programming language. Principles behind Rust and how they tie to Solana program development.

#### Lecture 3: [Solana programming model I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plp4y27LNWs)
> Let's start developing on-chain Solana programs using the Anchor framework. You'll understand how programs store data and state on the Solana blockchain. We will review all the important core concepts of Solana development: Accounts structure, Program Derived Addresses, Handling errors, and Cross-Program Invocations.

#### Lecture 5: Best development practices and debugging
> Develop like a pro! In this lecture, we will show you some of the best development practices and give you tips and tricks to debug your programs so you can get up to speed quickly.

#### Lecture 6: Front-end for Solana Programs
> Make your program alive! This lecture will show how to implement a simple front end for our Bank app using the official Solana scaffold.

#### Lecture 7: Security
> Hackers away! This lecture will introduce common vulnerability issues in Solana programs, how they can be exploited, and, most importantly, how to avoid them.

#### Lecture 8: Final Lecture aka Graduation
> In this final lecture, we will wrap up the School of Solana and showcase some of the best final projects.

#### Lecture 9: Bonus: SPL Token Program & Gaming
> 💰SPL Tokens- The tokens are everywhere! This lecture will show how to implement a simple program dealing with arbitrary SPL tokens.🕹️Gaming- Gaming is fun! Our guest lecturer, Jonas Hahn, from Solana Foundation, will show you how to implement a simple game on Solana using the Unity SDK.
